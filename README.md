# Gamelauncher
Keyboard and mouse controllable app for launching games or other programs.
So far this still needs AutoHotkey installed and one script to be included in %a_mydocuments%/AutoHotkey/Lib (found in my other repo), but I'm planning to remove the need for AHK as soon as I come up with good ways to launch programs with/without admin rights with Python only.

Oh, and for now it's Windows exclusive.
